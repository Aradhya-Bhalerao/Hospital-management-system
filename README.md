# JK Aarogya Plus

I spearheaded the development of a Comprehensive Hospital Management System utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP, and MySQL. This innovative system revolutionized hospital operations by offering a range of online services tailored to different user roles. Patients could effortlessly schedule appointments, receive automated confirmation emails, and access electronic prescriptions directly from their inbox. Meanwhile, administrators could dynamically update doctor and receptionist information, ensuring that the system remained up-to-date with real-time data. To bolster security, robust measures such as encrypted communications and secure password management were implemented. Automated email functionalities further enhanced user experience by providing seamless communication channels for tasks like password management, appointment confirmations, and prescription deliveries. This project not only optimized hospital workflows but also elevated patient care standards through efficient and secure digital solutions.
